Team Name: Buttercup

Proposal:
The project is mainly a first person view game, where the player can collect objects, the world is randomly generated, and so on. It will involve random spawning of rooms and hallways which the player can explore in addition to various "objects" which can be pretty random and may be collectable. The player would have a bow and arrow and can shoot. There wouldbe no lose condition, but it wins when it collects enought objects. Each "structure" or rooms/hallways would be a node, and each time the player passes through from one structure to another it will calculate node distances and despawn and spawn appropriate structures. It will also have a HUD, a menu, maybe music and sound effects.
